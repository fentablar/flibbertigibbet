            <h4>The series</h4>
            <p>The Aubrey&hyphen;Maturin series is a sequence of nautical historical novels &mdash; 20 completed and one unfinished &mdash; by Patrick O'Brian&comma; set during the Napoleonic Wars and centering on the friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy and his ship&apos;s surgeon Stephen Maturin&comma; a physician&comma; natural philosopher&comma; and intelligence agent&period;&ensp;The first novel&comma; Master and Commander&comma; was published in 1969 and the last finished novel in 1999&period;&ensp;The 21st novel of the series&comma; left unfinished at O&apos;Brian&apos;s death in 2000&comma; appeared in print in late 2004&period;&ensp;The series received considerable international acclaim and most of the novels reached <span class="mediaTitle">The New York Times</span> Best Seller list&period;&ensp;These novels comprise the heart of the canon of an author often compared to Jane Austen&comma; C&period; S&period; Forester and other British authors central to the English literature canon&period;</p>
            <h4>Internal chronology</h4>
            <p>O&apos;Brian&apos;s books were written and published in the same chronological sequence as the events they describe&comma; beginning with <span class="mediaTitle">Master and Commander</span>&comma; set in 1800&comma; and carrying through to the final novel&comma; set in late 1815 after the Battle of Waterloo.</p>
            <p>However&comma; they do not strictly follow history&period;&ensp;The first six books quickly move through twelve years of the Napoleonic Wars&comma; as established by frequent reference to historical events&comma; with <span class="mediaTitle">The Fortune of War</span> ending on 1 June 1813 with the battle between HMS <span class="mediaTitle">Shannon</span> and USS <span class="mediaTitle">Chesapeake</span>&period;&ensp;Yet the series then enters a kind of fantasy&hyphen;time in which it takes another dozen novels to progress to November 1813&period;&ensp;Much of this period is spent at sea&comma; with little or no connection to real-world years&comma; and the events of the novels take up substantially more time than the few months &lsquo;available&rsquo;&period;&ensp;External historical reference returns with <span class="mediaTitle">The Yellow Admiral</span>&comma; the 18th book in the series&period;&ensp;Towards the beginning of this novel&comma; it is stated that the British army under the Duke of Wellington has entered France from Spain&comma; which occurred in November 1813&period;&ensp;Time is then paused again for a few chapters&comma; as a narrative apparently lasting several months ensues before a specific arrival at Christmas 1813&period;&ensp;Thereafter&comma; the book and the next in the series &lpar;<span class="mediaTitle">The Hundred Days</span>&rpar; move swiftly through the historical events of Napoleon&apos;s disastrous invasion of Russia and his defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition&comma; his exile and escape from Elba&comma; and his final campaign and defeat in June 1815&period;&ensp;The last completed book in the series&comma; <span class="mediaTitle">Blue at the Mizzen</span>&comma; is the only volume which is set entirely after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars&period;</p>
            <p>In his introduction to <span class="mediaTitle">The Far Side of the World</span>, the 10th book in the series, O'Brian wrote that if the author &ldquo;had known how many books were to follow the first&comma; he would certainly have started the sequence much earlier&rdquo; in real historical time&period;&ensp;He goes on to explain that &ldquo;if his readers will bear with him&rdquo;&comma; books of the series will be set in &ldquo;hypothetical years&comma; rather like those hypothetical moons used in the calculation of Easter&colon; an 1812a as it were or even an 1812b&rdquo;&period;&ensp;In effect&comma; the period from June to December 1813 is stretched out to accommodate events that ought to occupy five or six years&period;</p>
            <h4>Period language and naval jargon</h4>
            <p>The stories are primarily told in third person from the points of view of the two main characters&comma; Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin&period;&ensp;The author sometimes employs a form of first person voice when his characters write in private journals or letters about events that are not otherwise described&period;&ensp;The narrative point of view strays from the two main characters only briefly and seldom over the course of the series&period;&ensp;One example is the opening scene of <span class="mediaTitle">The Hundred Days</span>&comma; in which a gossipy conversation between anonymous sailors imparts important news and information about the main characters&period;</p>
            <p>Patrick O&apos;Brian once wrote &ldquo;Obviously&comma; I have lived very much out of the world&colon; I know little of present&hyphen;day Dublin or London or Paris&comma; even less of post-modernity&comma; post-structuralism&comma; hard rock or rap&comma; and I cannot write with much conviction about the contemporary scene&period;&rdquo;&ensp;This becomes obvious for readers of the Aubrey&hyphen;Maturin Series&comma; as he adopts a narrative voice contemporary with their setting&period;&ensp;Richard Ollard&comma; in examining the general reception to O&apos;Brian&apos;s books&comma; suggests that O&apos;Brian&apos;s naval officers would be able to talk with and recognise Jane Austen&apos;s characters&period;</p>
            <p>In addition to the period language&comma; O&apos;Brian is adept at using naval jargon with little or no translation for the &ldquo;lubberly&rdquo; reader&period;&ensp;The combination of the historical&hyphen;voice narration and naval terms may seem daunting at first to some readers&semi; but most note that after a short while a &ldquo;total immersion&rdquo; effect results&period;&ensp;Occasionally&comma; O&apos;Brian explains obscure nautical terms by placing Stephen Maturin into the tutelage of seamen&comma; allowing the author to vicariously teach the reader about various parts and functions of a period sailing vessel without breaking from the narrative&period;&ensp;This was especially common early in the series&comma; when Maturin was still new to the Royal Navy&period;</p>
            <p>Also&comma; O&apos;Brian often addresses the historical events and themes within his books indirectly&comma; allowing a fuller immersion for his readers without flaunting his historical understanding unlike other similar nautical authors&period;</p>
            <h4>Humour</h4>
            <p>O&apos;Brian&apos;s bone&hyphen;dry and cutting wit is present throughout all his novels&period;&ensp;Its delivery&comma; whether in the form of narration or dialogue&comma; is often so forthright that the reader may not perceive it at first&period;&ensp;At times&comma; however&comma; O&apos;Brian will spend a considerable portion of a volume setting up comical sequences &mdash; for example&comma; Jack&apos;s use of rum in the &ldquo;debauchery&rdquo; of Maturin&apos;s pet sloth in <span class="mediaTitle">HMS Surprise</span> or Jack&apos;s assertion to William Babbington&comma; while discussing nautical terminology&comma; that &ldquo;Sheep ain&apos;t poetical&rdquo;&comma; supporting his statement by saying&colon; &ldquo;Remember that fellow in the play who calls out&colon; &lsquo;My Kingdom for a horse&rsquo;&quest;&ensp;Would not have been poetry at all&comma; had he said sheep&period;&rdquo;&ensp;&lpar;See <span class="mediaTitle">The Ionian Mission</span>&rpar;&ensp;Drunk animals are a common motif through the series&semi; for instance the following conversation between Jack and Stephen in <span class="mediaTitle">Post Captain</span>&colon; &ldquo;&lsquo;The carrier has brought you an ape&period;&rsquo;&ensp;&lsquo;What sort of an ape&quest;&rsquo; asked Stephen&period;&ensp;&lsquo;A damned ill&hyphen;conditioned sort of an ape&period;&ensp;It had a can of ale at every pot&hyphen;house on the road&comma; and is reeling drunk&period;&ensp;It has been offering itself to Babbington&period;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Puns &mdash; often &ldquo;bad&rdquo; on the part of Jack &mdash; are also common throughout the novels&comma; much to the chagrin of Stephen Maturin&period;&ensp;Jack takes a special&comma; perhaps overzealous&comma; interest in nautical puns&period;&ensp;For example&comma; Jack often repeats one of Stephen&apos;s spur&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;moment puns regarding dog&hyphen;watches&period;&ensp;At a dinner&comma; replying to a lubber&apos;s question on the term &lsquo;dog&hyphen;watch&rsquo; &lpar;<span class="mediaTitle">Post Captain</span>&comma; Chapter 12&rpar;&comma; Stephen suggests it is &ldquo;because they are curtailed&comma; of course&rdquo; &lpar;&ldquo;Cur Tailed&rdquo;&comma; &ldquo;cur&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;dog&rdquo;&rpar;&comma; and like other puns&comma; Aubrey repeats the witticism as often as occasion allows&period;&ensp;The use of humor contrasts the two central characters&period;&ensp;Aubrey is direct and forthright while Stephen is subtle and cunning&comma; mirroring the overall personality of each man&comma; especially regarding warfare tactics &lpar;ships&comma; cannons and swords compared to intelligence gathering&rpar;&period;</p>
            <p>O&apos;Brian has Aubrey speaking many proverbs&comma; but usually in mangled form&comma; such as &ldquo;There&apos;s a great deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot&rdquo; &lpar;from <span class="mediaTitle">Treason&apos;s Harbour</span> and similarly in <span class="mediaTitle">Desolation Island</span>&rpar;&period;&ensp;In <span class="mediaTitle">HMS Surprise</span> &lpar;Chapter 6&rpar;&comma; Aubrey says that &ldquo;A bird in the hand is worth any amount of beating about the bush&rdquo;&period;&ensp;Sometimes Aubrey gets in a muddle and Maturin affectionately mocks him by playing on the mixed metaphor&colon; &lsquo;&hellip; they have chosen their cake&comma; and must lie in it&period;&rsquo;&semi; Maturin replies&comma; &lsquo;You mean&comma; they cannot have their bed and eat it&quest;&rsquo; &lpar;also from <span class="mediaTitle">HMS Surprise</span>&comma; Chapter 7&rpar;&period;&ensp;Related to proverbs&comma; Aubrey tells Maturin a clever Wellerism&comma; &ldquo;&lsquo;It&apos;s not a fit night out for man or beast&comma;&rsquo; as the centaur observed&comma; ha&comma; ha&comma; ha&excl;&rdquo; &lpar;<span class="mediaTitle">Yellow Admiral</span>&rpar;&period;</p>
            <h4>Publication history</h4>
            <p><span class="mediaTitle">Master and Commander</span> was first published in 1969&comma; in the US by Lippincott&comma; and in Great Britain and Ireland by Collins in 1970&period;&ensp;The series continued to be a modest success in both countries&comma; though publication was only by Collins in the UK after the fourth novel&period;&ensp;Publication in the US ceased with <span class="mediaTitle">Desolation Island</span> in 1978&period;&ensp;However&comma; in 1989 Starling Lawrence of W&period;W&period; Norton discovered the novels on a plane flight between London and New York&period;&ensp; W&period; W&period; Norton began printing the books&comma; and they were taken more seriously by critics and became a publishing success&period;&ensp;O&apos;Brian&apos;s series of novels sold over 400&comma;000 copies in the next two years and continued to be a success&comma; selling over 2 million copies by 2000&period;&ensp;In its review of the last unfinished novel in 2004&comma; Publishers Weekly reported that the series had sold over 6 million copies&period;&ensp;W&period; W&period; Norton released the novels in e&hyphen;book format on 5 December 2011&period;&ensp;The full series has been published in German&comma; French and Italian translations&comma; the twenty finished books also in Spanish&comma; and part of the series in Catalan&comma; Chinese&comma; Czech&comma; Finnish&comma;, Japanese&comma; Polish&comma; Portuguese&comma; Swedish and Russian translation&period;</p>
            <h4>Literary significance and criticism</h4>
            <p>These novels comprise the heart of the canon of an author often compared to Jane Austen&comma; C&period; S&period; Forester and other British authors central to the English literature canon&period;&ensp;Though sometimes compared to Trollope&comma; Melville&comma; Conrad and even Proust&comma; the Aubrey&hyphen;Maturin series has most often been compared to the works of Jane Austen&comma; one of O&apos;Brian&apos;s greatest inspirations in English literature&period;&ensp;In a cover&hyphen;story in <span class="mediaTitle">The New York Times Book Review</span> published on 6 January 1991&comma; Richard Snow characterised Patrick O&apos;Brian&apos;s Aubrey&hyphen;Maturin naval adventure novels as &ldquo;the best historical novels ever written&period;&ensp;On every page Mr&period; O&apos;Brian reminds us with subtle artistry of the most important of all historical lessons&colon; that times change but people don&apos;t&comma; that the griefs and follies and victories of the men and women who were here before us are in fact the maps of our own lives&period;&rdquo;&ensp;And in a <span class="mediaTitle">Washington Post</span> article&comma; Ken Ringle wrote&comma; &ldquo;&hellip; the Aubrey&hyphen;Maturin series is better thought of as a single multi&hyphen;volume novel&comma; that&comma; far beyond any episodic chronicle&comma; ebbs and flows with the timeless tide of character and the human heart&period;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Frank McNally&comma; writing in honor of the author&apos;s 100th birthday&comma; reflects on the breadth of the appeal of the series of novels&comma; for the quality of the writing and the relationships between the characters&comma; which put them beyond the typical naval adventure&comma; and gain interest from readers who &ldquo;wouldn&apos;t touch Horatio Hornblower with a bargepole&period;&rdquo;&ensp;Lucy Eyre wrote to point out the appeal of the series to women readers&comma; mentioning the nautical detail&comma; and how it might be viewed the same as precise medical language on the television program ER&period;&ensp;She notes that &ldquo;O&apos;Brian is never heavy-handed with his research&colon; it&apos;s simply that the books are set in a perfectly realised world&comma; which happens to be a ship at war&period;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Even critics uninterested in the Aubrey&hyphen;Maturin series have praised the intricacy and character development of the books&period;&ensp;When reviewing <span class="mediaTitle">The Wine Dark Sea</span> in <span class="mediaTitle">The Hudson Review</span>&comma; Gary Krist is very critical of the plot of the books&comma; suggesting that the books are full of elements of &ldquo;pop fiction&rdquo; and O&apos;Brian&apos;s excessive &ldquo;delight in the sheer specificity of seafaring mechanics&period;&rdquo;&ensp;However&comma; he did not deny the qualities that &ldquo;push it close to that great&comma; fuzzy art&hyphen;entertainment meridian&rdquo; including character development and at times&comma; &ldquo;the sense of being in the presence of an active&comma; complex&comma; and compassionate intelligence&period;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Numerous authors have admired the Aubrey&hyphen;Maturin series&comma; including Iris Murdoch&comma; Eudora Welty and Tom Stoppard&period;&ensp;Science fiction author David Drake has stated that his Republic of Cinnabar Navy was inspired by the Aubrey&hyphen;Maturin books&period;</p>
